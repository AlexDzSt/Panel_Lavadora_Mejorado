<br>

This project represents a network of interconnected microcontrollers designed to simulate the control panel of a modern washing machine. At its core, this system replicates the primary user interface and operational functionalities found in typical washing machines, providing a comprehensive and realistic simulation environment.
This code implements a versatile system that not only simulates the control panel of a washing machine but also provides user interaction and real-time data communication. It ensures precise water level measurement and intuitive control through both auditory and visual feedback mechanisms.

<br>

**Key Features:**


_Buzzer with Specific Sounds:_

Each interaction with the control panel triggers a unique sound, providing auditory feedback to the user.


_Water Level Sensor:_

An analog sensor simulates a real washing machine tank by measuring the water level. The sensor is connected to the analog pin of the microcontroller, reading and scaling the data to obtain standarized value.


_WiFi Connectivity:_

Utilizing the WiFi functionality of the Raspberry Pi Pico W, the system connects to a server to log data for each washing cycle. This allows real-time updates and monitoring of the server information.


_UART Communication:_

The system can receive data via UART to compare the measured water level with an external reference, such as the selection function guiding by LEDs illuminated. If the water level exceeds this reference, an alert is triggered.

**Additional Functionalities:**

_Rotary LED Display_

The system includes a rotary LED display consisting of seven segments, which can be controlled by an analog input, in this case a potentiometer. Adjusting the potentiometer influences the segments' illumination, creating various patterns.

**Description of the code**

**Rotary LED Library (crotaryled.c/crotaryled.h)**

This library provides a comprehensive set of functions for controlling a rotary LED display, reading analog input from a potentiometer, and using UART for communication. It enables precise control of LED states and facilitates interaction with external devices through serial communication.

**Purpose:** Provides functions for controlling the rotary LED display and handling UART communication for washing machine cycle selection.

*PINS_SIZE*: Defines the constant size of the pins array.

*pins*: Declares a static array of uint32_t to store the digital pin assignments for the rotary LED display.

*rl_mask*: Declares a static uint32_t variable to hold the bit mask representing the active LED(s).

*rl_delay*: Defines the constant delay (in milliseconds) between reading the potentiometer and updating the LED (not defined in the given code, but typically would be).

*ANALOG_PIN*: Defines the GPIO pin used for analog input (potentiometer).

*UART_ID*: Defines the UART port used for communication.

*BAUD_RATE*: Defines the baud rate for UART communication.

*UART_TX_PIN*: Defines the GPIO pin used for UART transmission.

*UART_RX_PIN*: Defines the GPIO pin used for UART reception.

*rl_construct(const int a[])*: Initializes the pins array with the provided pin assignments.

*rl_init()*: Initializes the digital pins for the rotary LED as outputs, initializes the analog pin for potentiometer reading, and sets up UART communication.

*rl_read_value()*: Reads the analog value from the potentiometer and converts it to a bit mask representing the active LED(s) based on predefined threshold levels.

*rl_turn_led_on()*: Turns on the LED(s) determined by the rl_mask value.

*rl_clear()*: Turns off all LEDs in the rotary display.

*rotary_led()*: Calls rl_read_value to determine the active LED(s), turns them on, delays briefly, and then turns them off. Additionally, it sends UART messages corresponding to different washing machine cycles based on the active LED(s).

**Peripheral Control Library (peripherals.c/peripherals.h)**

This library provides essential functions for initializing and controlling various peripherals, including LEDs, buttons, and a 14-segment display. It allows for the efficient management of GPIO pins and offers simple interfaces for toggling LEDs, reading button states, and driving complex display segments.

**Purpose**: Provides functions for initializing and controlling LEDs, buttons, and a 14-segment display.

init_led(int pin): Initializes the specified GPIO pin for LED output.

encender_led(int pin): Toggles the state of the specified LED pin.

apagar_led(int pin): Turns off the LED connected to the specified pin.

init_boton(int pin): Initializes the specified GPIO pin for button input and enables the internal pull-up resistor.

leer_boton_OnOff(int boton_OnOff, int led_OnOff): Reads the state of the On/Off button and controls the associated LED. It returns true if the button is pressed, otherwise false.

init_display(int primer_gpio): Initializes the GPIO pins for a 7-segment display starting from the specified GPIO pin.

turn_display_on(int bits[], int val, int primer_gpio): Turns on the segments of a 7-segment display to represent the given value. The bits array contains the bit patterns for each digit.

**Pin Definitions (pin_list.h)**

This file provides a centralized location for all pin assignments, making the code more readable and easier to maintain. By defining these constants, changes to pin assignments can be made in one place without needing to update multiple parts of the code.

**Purpose**: Provides constant definitions for the pin assignments used in the washing machine control panel project, including pins for LEDs, switches, analog inputs, and UART communication.

*Rotary LED Display Pins*: These pins are assigned to the segments of the rotary LED display, enabling control of each segment individually.

*Analog Input Pin*: This pin is used to read analog signals, typically from a potentiometer, to control the rotary LED display.

*Switch Pins*: These pins are assigned to the various switches on the control panel, allowing the microcontroller to detect user inputs for on/off, cycle selection, and pause/resume.

*LED Pins*: This pin is assigned to an LED that indicates whether the system is turned on or off.

*UART Pins*: These pins are used for UART communication, allowing the microcontroller to send and receive data to/from other devices or systems.
